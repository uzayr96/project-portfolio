TFI is the company behind world's most well-known brands like Burger King, Popeyes etc. Restaurant business usually requires a large initial investment, in order to find better investment opportunities, investors would be able to make smart decisions on where to invest their capital. The competition is about creating a robust machine learning model that can predict the revenue of the restaurant based on features like City, Open Date, Demographics of the location, real estate and schools. The dataset is available on [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/restaurant-revenue-prediction/data).\n\n\n\nAs we can see from the above output, Type variable in the trainset have just 1 DT category and 0 MB category. ML models won't be able to predict on MB categories. So I will replace MB with DT.\n\n\nAfter getting dummies, I will remove special characters from the column names as xgboost algorithm will show error if the special characters are in the column names.\n\n## Importing ML packages\n\n## Custom Functions\nAs the training dataset is small, I will use repeated KFold cross validation to find out how our model performs before predicting on our final test dataset. For that I will create a custom function that takes our model, train dataset and number of folds. I will also include a default parameter of columns to remove incase I use it in the training.\n\nThe above parameters were randomly selected. The rmse of random forest from the cross validation score is around **160,000** and on the **public leaderboard(1% of the test data)** score we get around **183,000** and on the **private leaderboard (99% of the test data)** score we get around **182,000**.\n\n**Xgboost** on the public leaderboard performed way better than the randomforest but the private leaderboard result was quite similar.\n\n# Final RMSE Result (Approximately)\n1. Benchmark = 188,000.\n2. Best Score = 172,000.\n\n**My Result:**\n1. RandomForest : Private = 182,000, Public = 183,000.\n2. Xgboost : Private = 183,000, Public = 175,000.\n3. Blending RF and XGboost : Private = 180,000, Public = 176,900\n\nLooking at the final result, our model performed quite well given that the parameters were randomly selected and all of the features were selected. With Hyperparameter Optimization and feature selection, we can achieve better result given that our model was somewhere in the middle of the benchmark and best score.
