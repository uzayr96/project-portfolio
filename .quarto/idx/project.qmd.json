This suggests that initial investigations were performed to understand the data's characteristics, distributions of variables, and potential relationships. Weight of Evidence (WOE) and Information Value (IV) are calculated for the binned variables. WOE helps to transform categorical variables for logistic regression, and IV measures the predictive power of each variable. The performance of the logistic regression model is evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) on the test data. AUC measures the model's ability to distinguish between borrowers who will default and those who will not. The trained logistic regression model is used to predict the probability of default for each loan in the dataset. An awareness of potential avenues for model improvement, such as exploring different algorithms and addressing class imbalance is also included.\n\n[View Project](Credit%20Risk%20Modelling.ipynb)\n:::\n::: \n\n\n\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 1.
